This is a group assignment to see how Git works when more than one person works on a project.

We are going to make a code that asks the user for input from the user about whether they have a sphere, a box or a pyramid. The code will then ask the user for the appropriate input to calculate the volume of the object and the surface of its shadow (so the surface of the circle, square or parallelogram--assume the largest projection for this case, and triangle).

You will be split in 4 teams. Create a new branch (i.e, other than the Main) and give it a unique, characteristic name (e.g., Team_1_branch, Team_2_branch etc).  


-- Team 1 needs to make a function sphere_surface that takes R as input and calculates the surface of a circle. The function should return the calculated surface area. Team 1 should then make another function sphere_volume that uses R and calculates the volume of the corresponding sphere. The function should return the calculated volume.

-- Team 2 needs to make a function box_volume that takes as input the three sides a, b, c of a box and calculates its volume. The function should return the calculated volume. Team 2 should then make another function box_surface that takes the largest possible combination of a, b and c to calculate the surface of a square/parallelogram. The function should return the calculated surface area.

-- Team 3 needs to make a function pyramid_volume that takes as input the length of the sides x, y and height h of the pyramid and calculates its volume. The function should return the calculated volume. Team 3 should then make another function triangle_surface that takes the h and the largest of x and y to calculate the surface area of the triangle. The function should return the calculated surface area.

--Team 4 will make the code that binds all other codes together! Team 4 will make a code that asks the user for input for: 
  - if they have a sphere, box or pyramid. 
  - depending on the input above, ask for the necessary input to calculate the volume and surface area.
  The code should then call the appropriate function and print an informative statement about the volume and surface area of the object.


b)	Team 1 will commit and publish their branch. Check on the webbrowser, you should all then see a message that the current branch is published, and you can create a “Pull Request” and continue the collaboration in GitHub.
