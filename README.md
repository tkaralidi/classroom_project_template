This is a group assignment to see how Git works when more than one person works on a project.

You have to make a code that gets as input an array of x-axis points and a radius R of a circle. Then:

-- Team 1 needs to make a function that uses x and R and calculates all y coordinates (past HW) and make a function that calculates the diameter and surface of the circle

-- Team 2 needs to make a function that calculates the volume of a sphere with the given radius. Team 2 wil then make sure all functions are merged in the main branch and call them to run a code that given an input R calculates the y coordinates, diameter and surface of a circle and its corresponding volume if it were a sphere.
