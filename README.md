This is a group assignment to see how Git works when more than one person works on a project. 

You have to make a code that gets as input an array of x-axis points and a radius R of a circle. Then:

-- one of you needs to make a function that uses x and R and calculates all y coordinates 
-- one of you needs to make a function that calculates the diameter and surface of the circle
-- one of you needs to make a function that calculates the volume of a sphere with the given radius
-- one of you needs to lead the team, make sure all functions are merged in the main branch and call them 
   to run a code that given a input R calculates the y coordinates, diameter and surface of a circle and its
   corresponding volume if it were a sphere.
