This is a group assignment to see how Git works when more than one person works on a project.

We are going to make a code that asks the user for input from the user about whether they have a sphere, a box or a pyramid. The code will then ask the user for the appropriate input to calculate the volume of the object and the surface of its shadow (so the surface of the circle, square or parallelogram--assume the largest projection for this case, and triangle).

-- Team 1 needs to make a function sphere_surface that takes R as input and calculates the surface of a circle. The function should return the calculated surface area. Team 1 should then make another function sphere_volume that uses R and calculates the volume of the corresponding sphere. The function should return the calculated volume.

-- Team 2 needs to make a function box_volume that takes as input the three sides a, b, c of a box and calculates its volume, and another function box_surface that takes the largest possible combination of a, b and c to calculate the surface of a square/parallelogram.
